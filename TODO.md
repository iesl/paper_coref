__TODO__

__1. Task__

__June 30:__ Port current citation coreference to work with arbitrary extractions, rather than just ParCit. (The prototype citation coreference system that we delivered in January runs only on pre-run header and bibliographic extractions from ParCit, aligned with data from the ACL corpus, which consists of 15,475 entities across 114,654 header and bibliography mentions.)  Evaluate citation coreference on ParCit data using MUC, B3 and pairwise precision and recall metrics.

__2. Timeline__

__June 1.__ Run 3 processors on ACL Corpus

__June 1.__ Draft of universal paper data structure format

__June 4.__ Pick ~12 documents for debugging the pdf extraction output, reconsider universal format

__June 12.__ Finalize Universal Format

__June 17.__ First evaluation report

__3. PDF Processors__
