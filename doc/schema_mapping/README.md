# Schema Mapping #

Schema Mapping is the transformation of the structured schema of the information outputted by the PDF processors into the data structures used by the coreference algorithms (ParsedDocument, LocatedCitation, RawCitation). Schema mapping is necessary because each PDF processor gives a differently formatted output. The method by which this is done can have an impact on the final coreference results. This folder contains notes on how the schema mapping is done in this project.
